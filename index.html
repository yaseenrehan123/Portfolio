                            I started web-dev before graduation,

                            as i had already learned and built some projects in languages such as python,
                            My earlier projects were related to game-dev utilizing game engines such as Unity and Godot
                            before getting into web-dev.

                           I was always passionate about creating and designing things,
                           ever since i was a kid i was alot into science fiction,
                           wanting to create something awesome, when i discovered 
                           programming i immediately felt like it was the right thing for me, 
                           this is the thing i am interested in the most.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Eventually i discovered web-development,
                            the reason i partially stopped making games was so i can dive into the real world
                            of programming and interact with code and a new level other than 
                            making games in a engine,
                            i thought going into actual programming with give me better
                            understanding on how things are created,
                            and so that's how i started my journey!
